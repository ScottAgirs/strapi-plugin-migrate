  <summary>Using Apple Silicon M1?</summary>

_For users running on Apple Silicon M1, you may encounter errors thrown by `sharp`. You may need to re-install `libvps` or to build `sharp` manually following [this issue comment](https://github.com/lovell/sharp/issues/2460#issuecomment-751491241) in order to start the project._

</details>

### Prerequisites

First, check if you're using the [required versions of Node.js and npm](https://strapi.io/documentation/developer-docs/latest/installation/cli.html#step-1-make-sure-requirements-are-met).

The easiest (and at this point in time the best way) to develop this plugin is by adding it to an existing project by placing it into `/plugins` folder.
The below steps will help you to set up this on a fresh project, if you would like to add it to your project, omit the first 2 steps and start with step 3.

### 1. Fork a fresh Strapi (Playground) project [repository](https://github.com/ijsto/strapi-plugin-migrate)

- Fork the [Strapi Playground repository](https://github.com/ijsto/strapi-playground) to your own account.

### 2. Clone the Playground your computer

_replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your username ðŸ™‚_

```bash
git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/strapi-playground.git
```

### 3. Fork the [plugin repository](https://github.com/ijsto/strapi-plugin-migrate)

- Fork the [Strapi Plugin Migrate repository](https://github.com/ijsto/strapi-plugin-migrate) to your own account.

### 4. Clone Strapi Plugin Migrate to your project's `/plugins` folder.

_replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your username_ ðŸ™‚

```bash
mkdir plugins && cd plugins && git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/strapi-plugin-migrate.git migrate
```

_If you are cloning to an existing project with an existing `plugins` folder, omit the `mkdir plugins`_

### 5. Prepare the app and the Admin UI

You'll need to rebuild admin UI and start development from Strapi root folder.

```bash
cd .. && yarn && yarn build --clean && strapi develop --watch-admin
```

### 6. Develop

From here on you are good to go - make changes to files in the `/plugins/migrate` folder and they will be reflected in the browser.

#### Naming routes

Internal plugin routes for RESTful requests should follow this pattern:
```
/TARGET_TYPE/EXPORT_TYPE/ACTION_TYPE
```

For example:
```
/user-permissions/json/export
```

#### Organizing routes

We sort our routes by type. So when adding new routes we look at the block where the specific `TARGET_TYPE` is located and insert the snippet where seems appropriate.

### 7. Creating a PR

When creating a PR, please make sure your code is clean, and you describe 1) what you are changing; 2) why you are changing; 3) what you are adding; 4) why you are adding - and so on. As many details as you can that will help reviewing the PR.
